# pooledPH
Repository to hold data and code for the pooled analyses of all LNCO experiments inducing PH: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.09.26.678742v1

Data: stores the .xlsx file with all data from all the experiments. Experiments and labels explained within different sheets in the file

Code: 

The riPH file has all the main analyses described in the paper. Additionally, when doing the EHI and PDI models that have less participants it already has the priors from the previous step (see paper for description of why and how this was done)

The other 3 files are the same but include the priors for riPE, agency and self-touch
